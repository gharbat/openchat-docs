### Options

You can set up the chat bubble on any web page in two simple steps:
- Place the initialization JS function at the end of the `<body>` tag
```javascript
    initializeChatWidget({
        token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
        isFullScreen: true
    })
```

- Configure it (optional)

`isFullScreen` (bool) if enabled, the chat bubble will always take the full width and height of it's parent

`initialMessages` (array) if provided, the chat bubble will be initialized with those messages
